\section*{Task 3}
In this task we implement a method to check whether a real number is in an interval with full support, given a knot sequence, a degree of the spline basis and the number itself. The code can be seen in Appendix 1. \\
We tried our code for three different knot sequences, $k_1=(0, 0, 1, 1)$, $k_2=(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$ and $k_3=(0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 1, 1, 1)$, all with quadratic splines. For each of the scenarios, we tested our code with the real numbers $\{0.12, 0.24, 0.4, 0.53, 0.78, 0.8\}$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item For $k_1$, we found that all points were in intervals \textbf{without} full support.
	\item For $k_2$, we found that all points were in intervals \textbf{with} full support.
	\item For $k_3$, we found that all points were in intervals \textbf{with} full support.
\end{itemize}
The results were as expected, as an interval has full support when using quadratic splines, if there are 3 or more knots to the left of the interval as well as to the right of the interval.
